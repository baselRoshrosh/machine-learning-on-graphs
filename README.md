# Semester Project WS24/25 â€” Machine Learning on Graphs

## Overview

This project explores **machine learning techniques on graphs** to predict missing node features.  
We developed a full C++/Python pipeline that implements and compares three different strategies:

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (baseline)
- **Topo2Vec** (topology-based embeddings)
- **Attributed DeepWalk (ADW)** (attribute-aware random walks)

The goal was to restore incomplete graph data using topological and attribute information.  
We integrated our C++ core with Python via **pybind11** to enable flexible experimentation and evaluation.

## Key Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **Feature Imputation** on large attributed graphs
- ðŸš€ **C++ core** with high-performance data structures (adjacency arrays, efficient sampling)
- ðŸ”— **Python integration** using pybind11
- ðŸ”¬ **Graph Embedding** via SkipGram (adapted for graph structures)
- ðŸ§ª **Automated Testing and CI Pipelines** via GitLab CI
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation on real-world datasets**: Amazon, CoraFull, GitHub, Twitch, Genius

## Strategies

### ðŸ”¹ k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Baseline method.
- Predicts missing features by averaging over the `k` nearest neighbors.
- Graph topology used directly for neighbor selection (BFS search).

### ðŸ”¹ Topo2Vec
- Embedding-based method using **context subgraphs**.
- Neighborhood Affinity (NA) and Subgraph Affinity (SA) scores used for context selection.
- Embeddings learned using a graph-adapted SkipGram model.

### ðŸ”¹ Attributed DeepWalk (ADW)
- Random walks biased by **both** topological and attribute similarities.
- Edge weights calculated using a fusion of feature similarity (cosine similarity) and structural similarity (Jaccard index).
- Transition probabilities managed via **Alias Tables** for efficient sampling.

## Technologies Used

- **C++17** â€” main project language
- **Python 3** â€” scripting and evaluation
- **pybind11** â€” C++ to Python interface
- **CMake** â€” build system
- **GitLab CI/CD** â€” continuous integration
- **Git LFS** â€” large file management (datasets)

## Installation and Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/baselRoshrosh/semesterprojekt_ws2425.git
cd semesterprojekt_ws2425

# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run experiments or use the Python bindings
python scripts/run_experiment.py
```

## Results

We evaluated the strategies across several datasets. Key observations:

- **KNN**: Fast and stable baseline, good performance on simpler datasets.
- **Topo2Vec**: Strong topological feature recovery, but high computational cost.
- **ADW**: Conceptually promising (combining structure and attributes), but runtime issues limited final evaluation.

Despite technical challenges, the project delivered valuable insights into the effectiveness of graph-based learning techniques.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Implementing and optimizing graph data structures (Adjacency arrays, Alias sampling)
- Handling large datasets with Git LFS
- Dealing with C++ memory management issues (e.g., segmentation faults)
- Managing a full CI/CD pipeline for C++ and Python hybrid projects
- Collaboration under difficult conditions (remote work, sickness, tight deadlines)
